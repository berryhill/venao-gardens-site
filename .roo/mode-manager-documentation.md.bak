The Mode Manager is a specialized Roo mode designed to create, organize, update, and manage custom Roo modes. It implements changes directly based on user instructions without unnecessary planning or explanations.

## Purpose

The Mode Manager acts as an expert in Roo modes, providing capabilities for:

1. Creating new custom modes with all required components
2. Updating existing modes to incorporate new features or capabilities
3. Organizing the mode ecosystem for clarity and efficiency
4. Maintaining a cohesive mode ecosystem

## Key Capabilities

### Mode Creation and Implementation
- Generate properly structured YAML configurations
- Create system prompt files
- Set up rules directories and files
- Implement appropriate file permissions

### Mode Updates
- Directly implement requested changes
- Update system prompts and configurations
- Modify file permissions as needed

## Usage

### Creating a New Mode

To create a new custom mode:

1. Activate the Mode Manager:
   ```
   /mode tarxan-mode-manager
   ```

2. Request a new mode creation:
   ```
   Create a new custom mode for [purpose]
   ```

### Updating an Existing Mode

To update an existing mode:

1. Activate the Mode Manager:
   ```
   /mode tarxan-mode-manager
   ```

2. Request a mode update:
   ```
   Update the [mode-name] mode to [description of changes]
   ```

## Mode Structure

The Mode Manager creates and manages modes with the following structure:

1. **Mode Configuration** in `.roomodes`:
   ```yaml
   customModes:
     - slug: mode-slug
       name: 🔍 Mode Name
       description: Brief description of the mode
       roleDefinition: Detailed description of the mode's role
       whenToUse: Guidance on when to use the mode
       customInstructions: Specific behavioral guidelines
       groups:
         - read
         - - edit
           - fileRegex: \.(ext)$
             description: File types description
         - command
         - browser
         - mcp
   ```

2. **System Prompt File** at `.roo/system-prompt-mode-slug`

3. **Rules Directory** at `.roo/rules-mode-slug/` (if needed)

### Tarxan Workflow Agents

The Tarxan workflow consists of the following specialized agents working together in a strict sequence:

1. **Tarxan Orchestrator** (`tarxan-orchestrator`)
   - Coordinates the entire implementation workflow
   - Creates feature branches BEFORE any implementation work
   - Delegates specifically to `tarxan-implementation-agent` and `tarxan-documentation-agent` in sequence
   - Ensures each agent commits to the same feature branch
   - Provides specific web research instructions for `tarxan-implementation-agent`
   - Creates pull requests when all work is complete
   - NEVER writes code itself - strictly delegates implementation
   - NEVER reads the codebase itself - delegates that to specialized agents

2. **Tarxan Implementation Agent** (`tarxan-implementation-agent`)
   - Implements core functionality AND unit tests
   - MUST use web research for all resources before implementation
   - MUST ensure all unit tests pass before completing
   - Commits changes to the feature branch created by the orchestrator

3. **Tarxan Documentation Agent** (`tarxan-documentation-agent`)
   - Updates or creates documentation in the `docs` directory only
   - Commits documentation to the feature branch created by the orchestrator

### Workflow Process

1. `tarxan-orchestrator` receives issue and creates feature branch
2. `tarxan-implementation-agent` researches ALL resources via web and implements core functionality AND unit tests on that branch
3. `tarxan-documentation-agent` updates documentation on that branch
4. `tarxan-orchestrator` creates pull request from that branch to dev

All agents work on the same feature branch created by the `tarxan-orchestrator`, and each agent commits their changes to this branch. The workflow is strictly sequential, with each agent waiting for the previous one to complete before starting their work. The `tarxan-implementation-agent` must thoroughly research all resources using the web before beginning implementation and MUST ensure all unit tests pass before completing.

## Branch Management Rules

The following agents should NEVER switch branches or pull from dev:
- `tarxan-implementation-agent`
- `tarxan-documentation-agent`

Branch management is the EXCLUSIVE responsibility of the `tarxan-orchestrator` agent. The specialized agents should work on whatever branch they find themselves on and only commit their changes when their specific task is complete. The orchestrator handles all branch creation, switching, and management operations.

## Mode Updates - 2025-08-05 (Branch Management)

### Implementation, UnitTest, IntegrationTest, and Documentation Agents
- Added critical directive that these agents should NEVER switch branches or pull from main
- Clarified that branch management is the responsibility of the orchestrator agent

- Removed instructions for these agents to checkout or pull branches
- This change ensures proper branch management workflow where only the orchestrator handles branch operations

## Mode Updates - 2025-08-06 (Tool Usage Guidelines)

### Common Tool Usage Guidelines
- Added `.roo/rules/02-tool-usage-guidelines.md` with common tool usage guidelines for all agents
- Added specific guidelines for execute_command, file operations, and MCP tools
- Included examples of proper tool usage for common operations
- This change ensures all agents follow consistent tool usage patterns

### Agent-Specific Tool Usage Guidelines
- Added agent-specific tool usage guideline files to each agent's rules directory:
  - `.roo/rules-tarxan-orchestrator/02-tool-usage-guidelines.md`
  - `.roo/rules-tarxan-implementation-agent/02-tool-usage-guidelines.md`
  - `.roo/rules-tarxan-unittest-agent/02-tool-usage-guidelines.md`

  - `.roo/rules-tarxan-delegator/02-tool-usage-guidelines.md`
- Each file contains agent-specific examples and guidelines
- Emphasized proper parameter usage for all tool functions

### Critical Tool Usage Rules
- ALWAYS provide a command parameter when using execute_command
- ALWAYS provide a path parameter when using file operation tools
- PREFER using MCP tools over direct command line operations when possible
- These changes address errors where Roo was attempting to use tools without providing required parameters
- Specifically fixes the issue with Tarxan-Orchestrator mode throwing an error when using execute_command without a command parameter

- **Documentation Alignment**: Updated workflow documentation to reflect specific agent names
- **Improved Task Creation**: Example task creation now uses `tarxan-implementation-agent` mode

This change ensures the orchestrator has precise knowledge of which specific Roo modes to delegate to, eliminating any ambiguity in the delegation process.

## Mode Updates - 2025-09-25 (Dev Branch Integration)

### tarxan-orchestrator
- **CRITICAL BRANCH UPDATE**: Changed root branch from `main` to `dev` throughout the workflow
- **Git Workflow Updates**: All Git operations now use `dev` as the base branch:
  - `git checkout dev` instead of `git checkout main`
  - `git pull origin dev` instead of `git pull origin main`
  - Feature branches created from `dev` branch
  - Pull requests target `dev` branch instead of `main`
- **Task Template Updates**: Updated all example Git commands in task templates to use `dev` branch
- **Workflow Documentation**: Updated documentation to reflect `dev` as the primary integration branch

This change aligns the orchestrator with a development workflow where `dev` serves as the primary integration branch, with `main` likely reserved for production releases.

## Mode Updates - 2025-09-25 (Exclusive Branch Management)

### tarxan-orchestrator
- **EXCLUSIVE BRANCH MANAGEMENT**: Orchestrator now has sole responsibility for all branch operations
- **Simplified Agent Instructions**: Removed Git workflow instructions from task templates for downstream agents
- **Agent Workflow Simplification**: `tarxan-implementation-agent` and `tarxan-documentation-agent` now work on whatever branch they find themselves on
- **No Branch Instructions to Agents**: Orchestrator no longer tells downstream modes to checkout or pull branches
- **Centralized Git Control**: All branch creation, switching, and management operations handled exclusively by orchestrator

### Branch Management Rules Updated
- Updated documentation to reflect that only `tarxan-orchestrator` handles branch management
- Specialized agents (`tarxan-implementation-agent`, `tarxan-documentation-agent`) never switch branches
- Agents work on current branch and only commit their changes when complete

This change centralizes all Git branch management under the orchestrator, simplifying the workflow for specialized agents and preventing potential branch conflicts.

## Mode Updates - 2025-12-09 (Platform Tools Agent)

### tarxan-platform-tools-agent (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Maintaining Platform Agent tools, tests, and knowledge aligned with implementations
- **Key Features**:
  - Analyzes newly implemented features to identify needed Platform Agent tools
  - Creates new tools in `agent/platform_agent/tools/` following existing patterns
  - Writes comprehensive tests in `agent/platform_agent/tools/tests/`
  - Updates tool schemas following the existing format in the codebase
  - Updates the Platform Agent's system prompt when capabilities change
  - Creates/updates knowledge base documentation in `docs/PLATFORM_AGENT_*.md`
  - Ensures tools are properly registered and exported
  - Runs tests to verify tool functionality before completing
- **Workflow Position**: Triggered CONDITIONALLY after Implementation Agent and Documentation Agent
- **File Permissions**: Full edit access to all files
- **Branch Management**: Does NOT switch branches - orchestrator handles branch management

### Platform Feature Detection
The orchestrator now detects whether a feature requires Platform Agent tools:

**ENGAGE Platform Tools Agent for:**
- Pipelines (create, list, status, cancel, run)
- Workflows (list, details, execution)
- Agents (content generation, research, image generation)
- Integrations (social media publishing, OAuth connections, third-party services)
- Monitoring (health checks, metrics, activity tracking)
- Any feature that adds new operations users can perform on the platform

**DO NOT ENGAGE Platform Tools Agent for:**
- Authentication/Auth changes (login, logout, session management)
- UI/Style changes (CSS, layouts, visual updates)
- Infrastructure/DevOps changes (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- Documentation-only changes
- Bug fixes that don't add new platform capabilities
- Refactoring that doesn't change functionality

### Updated Workflow Sequence
The orchestrator workflow now conditionally includes the Platform Tools Agent:
1. `tarxan-orchestrator` receives issue and creates feature branch
2. `tarxan-orchestrator` detects if this is a PLATFORM FEATURE
3. `tarxan-implementation-agent` implements core functionality AND unit tests on that branch
4. `tarxan-documentation-agent` updates documentation on that branch
5. **IF PLATFORM FEATURE**: `tarxan-platform-tools-agent` creates/updates Platform Agent tools and tests on that branch
6. `tarxan-orchestrator` creates pull request from that branch to dev

This addition ensures the Platform Agent stays aligned with new platform features, while avoiding unnecessary tool creation for non-platform changes.
